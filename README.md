### Hi friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Biology Ph.D. Candidate at Boston University studying the vibration-cued early hatching behavior of *Agalychnis callidryas* (red-eyed treefrogs). My field work is conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa, Panama. Basically, I get to chase frogs by night and shake embryos by day! Don't tell my advisor, but I'm usually secretly rooting for the snakes (egg predators)... :snake: Working outdoors in sweaty, soggy, buggy, humid, normally deplorable conditions makes me really happy. In my free time I love to climb all the things, doodle, and snuggle with the pup. 

Update: I got a postdoc! I'll be graduating in May and joining the Werner lab at U of Utah in June 2021 ::tada::
