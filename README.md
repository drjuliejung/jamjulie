### Hi friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Biology Ph.D. Candidate at Boston University studying the vibration-cued early hatching behavior of *Agalychnis callidryas* (red-eyed treefrogs). My field work is conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa, Panama. Working outdoors in sweaty, soggy, buggy, humid, normally deplorable conditions makes her really happy.
